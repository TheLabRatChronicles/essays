# Built to Provoke: The Economics of Sensationalism
<b>How digital platforms learned to monetize your emotions.</b>

In today’s media ecosystem, information can’t be passive anymore. In fact, it’s expected to perform. It needs to yield results through whatever messaging is being used. Nothing is wasted. Often, every little editorial detail is premeditated to result in clicks, shares, comments, emotional reactions, or any other sign of human engagement. This type of engagement should not be accidental. That kind of engagement is essentially the lifeline of the medium itself — the digital medium. If the only thing content delivery accomplishes is the act of informing, as in the golden age of objective journalism, at least in financial terms, then such content is dead on arrival. Today’s hyper-demanding thirst for compelling content ensures its demise. Sensationalism, inside that media bubble, isn’t merely an editorial decision of style — it’s the Swiss Army knife of media survival. A calm and collected disposition of information expects nothing and gets nothing, whereas sensationalism expects reactions and, if successful, gets engagement.

Since media platforms only incentivise reactions, increasingly stronger reactions are sought in an effort to acquire greater incentives. Provocation, rage-bait, stimulating takes on any subjects are now the new rules of the digital age.

This change in direction, from informing to triggering a response, rewires today’s journalism as well as the public conversation and the propaganda that grows inside those conditions.

This article is all about how our media architecture changed and why it continues to flourish, as well as the incentive mechanism that puts sensationalism at the forefront of all information delivery.

By looking at the human, financial, and technological drives interacting in this new media ecosystem, we get a broad picture and better comprehension of how this engagement-compulsory environment generates the psychological field that allows propaganda to flourish unimpeded.

### I. The Shift from Limited News to Limited Attention
<b>Why Traditional News Didn’t Need Emotional Hooks</b><br>
Information shortage was, for the most part, a defining characteristic of 20th-century news organisations. Large news networks, local broadcasters, and newspapers were limited in numbers and as a result were able to carry stable audiences. Their reputation, credibility, and reach largely determined their competitiveness. Revenues poured in a relatively consistent manner not because of emotional stimuli but because of an intellectually captive subscriber base.

Because of a limited number of news outlets, the final selection of news items had to be moderated due to the limited number of slots, pages, column sizes, or broadcast time. Editorial oversight ensured that the right pieces of news filled the limited number of slots. Objectivity wasn’t a foregone conclusion, but moderation helped it along. It was under those conditions that careful reporting was profitable. Concise, to-the-point news was expected by readers, rather than a daily dose of emotional fix.

<b>New Incentives in the Age of Infinite Content</b><br>
If the pre-digital era experienced a limited supply of news forcing self-moderation then today’s digital era has produced the opposite. The internet has generated a quasi-unlimited amount of information, while audience attention remains disproportionately limited. The new chokepoint is now visibly the consumer bandwidth rather than the ability to produce. This shift is what scholars call the attention economy: the new scarcity is no longer information but rather the attention to that information.[1]

Using human nature as the blueprint, algorithms now decide visibility (and therefore revenue) by rewarding content that triggers powerful emotions,[3] producing high-engagement signals (clicks, watch time, comments) that platforms use to rank and recommend content.[2] The end result is one where informational, triggerless content performs unimpressively inside a system designed for faster engagement, extreme emotions, and constant stimulation.

This profit engine has bifurcated from a subscription-based captive audience to an engagement-based model, changing the survivability of messages and therefore altering how public conversation is steered.

If the new profit engine incentivises attention instead of knowledge, then this begs the question: What triggers the emotional fix? The psychological aspects of sensationalism demand a proper examination.

### II. Why Outrage Works: The Psychology Behind Sensationalism
<b>A. The Evolutionary Advantage of Negative Information</b><br>
From an evolutionary perspective, our brains are designed to prioritise negativity over positivity. Research shows that what is remembered more consistently, processed more deeply, and attracts attention more rapidly is negative information.[4] This tendency served an important function: it allowed organisms to react quickly to perceived threats, increasing survival odds. Sensationalism exploits this instinct by highlighting danger, moral outrage, and conflict.

<b>B. The Salience Network: Why Novelty Feels Important</b><br>
How we respond to novelty is the responsibility of the brain’s reward system. Each time new and emotional claims are delivered, our reward system, known as the salience network, makes that information appear more important than it really is.[5]

Similar to novelty and emotional claims, conflict seizes our attention and produces emotional spikes through antagonism, social division, and moral outrage. These reactions are not defects, but demonstrations of ancient circuitry drowned in a modern environment of mass information delivery.

<b>C. Why We Become Suggestible When Emotions Run High</b><br>
Our ability to think critically is diminished by emotional arousal through a cognitive shift from intentional thinking to automatic thinking.[6] Therefore, sensationalism triggers the emotional arousal that weakens critical judgment, and this is where propaganda intervenes: it exploits these cognitive conditions. Propaganda thrives under these conditions, when audiences are overloaded, emotionally stimulated, or cognitively fatigued, because such states impair reflective judgment and heighten susceptibility to simplified narratives.[7] These psychological characteristics make sensationalist content an especially effective tool and leave audiences more impressionable.

The sensationalism-propaganda feedback loop is formed by the interdependence created when sensationalism takes advantage of our evolutionary brain patterns, which propaganda then feeds into precisely when our reasoning is most diminished.

### III. The Loop That Turns Outrage Into Influence
Sensationalism and propaganda are not identical, but in digital environments they reinforce each other so tightly that disentangling them becomes difficult. To understand this dynamic clearly, it helps to define propaganda in a way suited to the digital age.

Over the past several months, I’ve been preparing a white paper focused on refining a method-based definition of propaganda. Its central proposal appears here for the first time: the Method-Based Definition of Propaganda, intended as a unifying framework for the digital age. This definition is still a work in progress, and will likely evolve as the broader DSTF-16 framework is finalized.[12]:

<blockquote>
  <p>
Propaganda is any communicative act or system, intentional or unintentional, that predictably and systematically steers people toward a specific interpretation, belief, or action by using manipulative techniques that reduce, overwhelm, or bypass voluntary critical reasoning (such as omission, selective framing, distortion, strategic ambiguity, emotional flooding, manufactured urgency, deceptive contextual engineering, or engineered repetition/social proof). Strong, truthful emotional appeals that preserve space for critical thought are not propaganda. The term is used not to assign blame, but to increase awareness, helping both senders and receivers notice how influence works so that choices can become more freely made.
  </p>
</blockquote>

With this in mind, the sensationalism–propaganda relationship works through a recurrent loop:
<ol>
<li>Sensationalism seizes our attention. Algorithms amplify emotionally charged content, and engagement begets visibility.

<li>Propaganda inserts itself into the seized attention. Emotionally primed audiences gravitate toward certainty, identity reinforcement, and clear moral narratives.

<li>To remain competitive, sensationalism needs to top itself. Emotional intensity escalates. Yesterday’s sensationalism becomes today’s neutral.

<li>Propaganda deployment becomes easier. Manipulative narratives blend seamlessly into an ecosystem that rewards emotional extremes.
</ol>
What emerges is a self-propagating cycle where sensationalism delivers the attention and propaganda supplies the interpretation. This dynamic resembles what researchers describe as an information disorder.[10]

The consequences of this feedback loop require an understanding of what is lost when sensationalism sets the terms of visibility. The most significant casualties are independence of thought and nuance.

### IV. Why Moderate Ideas Vanish Online
<b>A. Why Digital Media Punishes Slow Thinking</b><br>
We acquire complex ideas through the slow, attentive absorption of context, background, and explanation, which is exactly the kind of slow processing that digital media refuses to reward. The system chases immediacy and quick emotional fixes, inevitably depriving nuance of its core requirement: deliberate, unhurried digestion of information. Ultimately, slow and careful analysis gets punished.

<b>B. Careful Thinking Requires Intellectual Effort</b><br>
In our current media landscape, two things are rationed for the proper consumption of analytical information: attention and reflection. Consuming nuance is less attractive and intellectually more expensive than emotional highs.[8] One demands effort while the other delivers ease and simplicity. The result quietly suppresses careful thought.

<b>C. Why We Distrust Nuance</b><br>
Audiences increasingly lean toward confident statements rather than nuanced explanations, which feel like uncertainty.[9] Where sensationalism delivers certainty and encourages propagation, nuance delivers qualifiers and encourages discussion. In the end, the complexity of public discussion is viewed as weakness.

<b>D. The Visibility Cost of Calm Debate</b><br>
By design, nuance is collected and grounded, triggering fewer comments, heated discussions, and shares. In a digital landscape managed by algorithmic metrics, this lack of conflict frequently renders grounded and thoughtful discussion invisible.

If nuance can’t hold its own in an attention economy, then journalistic restraint will not be the solution, since it operates under the same conditions. The incentive structure itself must be addressed.

### V. Toward a Media Landscape Not Driven by Emotion
Could sensationalism be reduced if journalists voluntarily refrained from using it? The problem is not one of morality but instead structure.

<b>A. The Structural Forces Behind Emotional Content</b><br>
An ad-based revenue stream that rewards attention rather than public service.

A distribution model encouraging viral content instead of information quality.

Audience conditioning to emotional highs that generates demand for more.

A lack of time in people’s lives, increasing demand for quick, emotionally satisfying content.

<b>B. Promising Directions for Media Reform</b><br>
Better incentives for non-sensationalistic reporting include:

Membership-based journalism, where algorithmic metrics are far less important.

Philanthropic and grant-funded journalism, which does not require emotional hooks to survive.

Media literacy programs that teach audiences how to detect emotional manipulation.

Slow media platforms that prioritise depth over immediacy.

These options are not silver bullets, but they do show that healthier incentive systems produce healthier information and that a self-aware movement exists to improve the media landscape.

<b>C. Why Individuals Matter More Than Institutions</b><br>
Unless we change the financially motivated algorithmic infrastructure that determines visibility, sensationalism cannot be meaningfully subdued. The media ecosystem is engineered for emotional triggers, not informational accuracy.

Because the landscape is so deeply wired in its current form, the most effective changes lie with individuals rather than institutions.

### VI. How to Resist Sensationalism
Even though reforming the media ecosystem is difficult, individuals can develop resistance to sensationalism through deliberate habits:

Emotional highs often signal manipulation attempts.

Variety weakens dominance: expose yourself to multiple ideological perspectives.

Choose depth over immediacy because depth strengthens interpretive autonomy.

Monitor your daily media intake, and identify outlets that provoke rather than inform.

Don’t be quick to click — slow down. Low-arousal content rarely goes viral because it requires slow, deliberate engagement.[11]

Recognize clickbait in clickable headings, thumbnails, and other imagery.

These practices will not necessarily reform the media landscape, but they will weaken sensationalism’s psychological grip as more people engage in them.

### VII. What’s at Stake in the Age of Sensationalism
Some might see sensationalism as journalistic weakness. In fact, journalism has adapted to the new reality. Sensationalism has become economically viable because we’ve evolved into an environment where attention is scarce, competition is unforgiving, and emotional triggers determine visibility. Yet this evolution carries consequences for democracy and individual autonomy. Each time conflict, outrage, and novelty are rewarded, the conditions for propaganda strengthen.

Today, it is a civic necessity to recognize this dynamic. The information landscape expects our attention. Mandatory engagement thrives on manipulation. Consumers must therefore become inner-directed: operating from an internal locus of control and learning to be less reactive to provocation. This does not mean distrusting everything, but approaching information proactively instead of passively. Only under these conditions can democratic discussion withstand the pressures of sensationalism.
